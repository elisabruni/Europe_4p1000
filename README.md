# Europe_4p1000
Implementation of multiple SOC models statistically calibrated to predict C input requirements to reach a 4‰ SOC stock increase at the European scale.

Project founded by CLAND (https://cland.lsce.ipsl.fr/) and Holisoils (https://holisoils.eu/)

Several SOC models are run over the LUCAS cropland sites (https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/lucas) to estimate the C input requirements in order to reach a 4‰ SOC stock increase target in Europe (https://4p1000.org/).
Model parameters are estimated using a statistical approach that links calibrated parameters from Bruni et al. (2022) to environmental variables.
